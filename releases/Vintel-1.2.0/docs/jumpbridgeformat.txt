<b>How to format the data for the jumpbridges:</b>

Put all the jumpbridges in one single textfile, where a line in the file
represents a jumpbridge.

The line contains the first system, the connection between the systems and
the second system. Between the three parts hast to be a space.

The connection is a line (minus) in the middle and possible arrows (sign for
greater or lower) at the ends. If there is such a sign, an arrow will be
drawn on the map.

Examples:

System1 <-> System2
System3 <- System4
System5 - System6

The first line will draw a jumpbridge between System1 and System2 with an 
arrow on both sides.
The second line will draw a jumpbridge between System3 and System4, but only
the side to System3 will have an arrow pointing on the system (could be helpfull
for "oneway"-jumpbridges).
The last line draws a line between System5 and System 6 and no arrows at the 
endpoints.

Write the systemnames as they are written in the maps.
Don't forget the space between the Systemnames and the jumpbridge!
