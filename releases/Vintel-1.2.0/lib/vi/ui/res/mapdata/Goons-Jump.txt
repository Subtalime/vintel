Jump Gates

An Upwell Ansiblex Jump Gate is a structure that links two systems up to 5 light years apart. Players can use them to navigate between star systems and jump much like a capital ship.

GSOL manages all Upwell Jump Gates. However, if you find a Jump Gate that has ran out of Liquid Ozone, anyone can deposit more fuel into a structure. Please have someone in your corp leadership ping GSOL to refuel any out of fuel Jump Gates you may find.

Note: This map shows four pairs differently than the table ; Dotlan doesn't recognize the moons in the actual table.

Known Jump Gates

Grouped by region (see maps below).

Jump Gate access is based on Access Lists.

If you are adding new Jump Gates to this list, and want to use a new color, make sure to pick a valid HTML Color Name to use, or it won't show up. If you don't know the Jump Gate ly distance, use the dotlan jump route planner to find out. Also, please enter the correct planet and moon number so that GARPA will show the jump gates correctly, or else it will not work.

Using a Jump Gate

Jump Gates appear in your overview, when configured correctly, the option to turn them on in located under Structure->Upwell Jump Gates

    Use a player-built Jump Gate just like you would a normal Stargate. Right click on the structure in your overview and click Jump OR use the right-click context menu to see the Jump Gate and right-click Jump.


Your Ship's Mass and You

Your ship mass affects the amount of ozone needed for your ship to jump. There are two things that can increase your ship's mass. Be aware of them when traveling through jumpbridges.

    Any online armor plates (1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten, for example) will increase your ship's mass. Offline them if possible.
    Having your MWD or AB active will increase your ship's mass. Make sure it's not running.
    (Nanofibers/Polycarbs don't affect mass as of Quantum Rise)

Things to note

    Like a normal Stargate, you are cloaked for 60 seconds on the other side of a gate once you go through, as long as you do not begin to move.
    No racial isotopes are required to use an array, only liquid ozone within the stargate.
    The liquid ozone is required in the array you are jumping FROM, and not your destination. GSOL is responsible for refueling Imperium Jump Gates
    Jump Gates must be a minimum of 200 km from a Citadel so while they are within gunning range of most citadels, they are not within tether range.
    Jump Gates have a 1,480,000,000kg mass limit, preventing certain carrier fits from using them. Supercapitals and Titans cannot use Jump Gates.
    There is a fee for using the Jump Gates, you can set this to autopay based on a value you set per unit of ozone in your wallet under "Automatic Pay Settings".
