Select which regions you would like to appear on the Dropdown-Menu.
It will look for ".svg" file with the same name in the folder
<mapdir>. 
Example:
Region "Catch" looks for <mapdir>/Catch.svg
If it cannot find that file, it will download it from Dotlan and
store it in this location for future use.
If you build your own ".svg" (i.e. using the tools/concatmaps.py)
place them in the same folder under a chosen name of your own and 
enter that File in the "Region-Files" input box. If you have multiple
files, make sure to comma-separate them.
Example:
Region-Files: my_own.svg,Secret.svg
The program will look for <mapdir>/my_own.svg and 
<mapdir>/secret.svg and create entries "my_own" and "Secret" 
in the Dropdown-Menu for you to select.
