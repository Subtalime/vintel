Rough notes from re-creation of the Providencecatch.svg by combining Providence.svg
and Catch.svg. The systems that connect the two must be changed - duplicates removed
and links between them updated. Then groups of systems must be moved so there are no
overlaps - nost of catch placed below provi and a few other similar changes. When, due
to a sov change or other events, the map must be regenerated, the notes below can be
used to create a python script using BeautifulSoup to make these edits.

- Change map goup name to Providence / Catch
- Add symbol(s) in defs, from Catch to Provi
- Add line(s) from Catch to Provi
- Add use(s) from Catch to Provi
- Add transform="translate(400,-175)" to specific Providence line and use instances
- Modify end points on specific lines
